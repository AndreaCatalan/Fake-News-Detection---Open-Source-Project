## Introduction

This project aims to identify fake news articles using machine learning techniques. By analyzing text data from various sources, we can classify news as either fake or real. The model can be tested manually with custom input for quick verification.<br>

## Motivation

I created this project to improve my machine learning and Python skills. Throughout the development process, I utilized various YouTube tutorials to guide my understanding and implementation of the techniques used.<br>

## Datasets

The project utilizes three datasets:<br>

Fake.csv - Contains fake news articles. <br>
True.csv - Contains real news articles. <br>
manual_testing.csv - A dataset for testing custom news articles. You can paste any news text to determine its classification.<br>


## Manual Testing

You can test custom news articles using the manual_testing function, which provides predictions from all trained models. Simply input the news text, and the models will classify it as either "Fake News" or "Not A Fake News".<br>
